## Notes
Isolated System: A system for where the net external force is zero ($F_{net} = 0$).

During projectile motion and where air resistance is negligible, momentum is conserved in the horizontal direction because horizontal forces are zero.

Conservation of Momentum Principle: Total Momentum stays constant in an isolated system.
