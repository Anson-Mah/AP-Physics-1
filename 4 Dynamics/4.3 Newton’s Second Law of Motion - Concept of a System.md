## Learning Objectives
- Define net force, external force, and system.
- Understand Newton’s second law of motion.
- Apply Newton’s second law to determine the weight of an object.

## Newton's Second Law of Motion
- $F = ma$
- The net Force equals mass times acceleration
- Acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force

## Units of Force
- The SI unit of force is the Newton (N)
- 1 N = 1 kg * m/s<sup>2</sup>
- One Newton is the force needed to accelerate a 1 kg system at the rate of 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>
- 1 Newton equals 0.225 pounds, or 1 N = 0.225 lb

## Other
- A net external force causes acceleration
- Net External Force - The vector sum of all external forces
- Weight is the gravitational force on a mass
- Weight equals mass times g
  - Since g varies based on location, weight can also vary based on location.
