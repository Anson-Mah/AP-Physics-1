## Definitions
- Dynamics - The study of forces that cause things to move
- Force - A push or pull
  - Has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector

## Newton's First Law of Motion
- An object currently at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by a net external force
- An object currently in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force
- Also known as the "Law of Inertia"

## Inertia
- Inertia - The ability to comply with Newton's First Law of Motion
- Some objects have more inertia than others 
  - It is more difficult to change the motion of a massive rock compared to something like a football. The massive rock has more inertia than the football because the rock is more difficult to change its state of motion.
- The inertia of an object is measured by its mass.

## Newton's Second Law of Motion
- $F = ma$
- The net Force equals mass times acceleration
- Acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force

## Units of Force
- The SI unit of force is the Newton (N)
- 1 N = 1 kg * m/s<sup>2</sup>
- One Newton is the force needed to accelerate a 1 kg system at the rate of 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>
- 1 Newton equals 0.225 pounds, or 1 N = 0.225 lb

## Net External Force
- A net external force causes acceleration
- Net External Force - The vector sum of all external forces

## Weight
- Weight varies with location, while mass does not.
- Weight is the gravitational force on a mass
- Weight equals mass times g
  - Since g varies based on location, weight can also vary based on location.

## Newton's Third Law of Motion
- Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.
- Every action has an equal but opposite reaction
