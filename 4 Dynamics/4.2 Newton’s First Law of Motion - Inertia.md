## Learning Objectives
- Define mass and inertia.
- Understand Newton's first law of motion.

## Newton's First Law of Motion
- An object currently at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by a net external force
- An object currently in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force
- Also known as the "Law of Intertia"

## Other
- Intertia - The ability to comply with Newton's First Law of Motion
- Some objects have more intertia than others 
  - It is more difficult to change the motion of a massive rock compared to something like a football. The massive rock has more intertia than the football because the rock is more difficult to change its state of motion.
- The intertia of an object is measured by its mass.
- Weight varies with location, while mass does not.
