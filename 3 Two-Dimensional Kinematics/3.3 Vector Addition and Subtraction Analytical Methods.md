## Learning Objectives
- Understand the rules of vector addition and subtraction using analytical methods.
- Apply analytical methods to determine vertical and horizontal component vectors.
- Apply analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of a resultant vector.

## Notes
- Analytical methods of vector addition use geometry and trigonometry.
- Analytical methods are more concise, accurate, and precise than graphical methods.
  - Graphical Methods are limited by the accuracy to which a drawing can be made.
  - Analytical methods are limited only by the accuracy and precision with which the physical quantities are known.
