## Learning Objectives
- Observe that motion in two dimensions consists of horizontal and vertical components.
- Understand the independence of horizontal and vertical vectors in two-dimensional motion.

## Notes
- The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
- For 2D motion, the path of an object can be represented with 3 vectors
  - The stright-line path between initial and final points
  - A vector showing horizontal motion
  - A vector showing vertical motion
- The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are independent of each other.
- Any motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.
