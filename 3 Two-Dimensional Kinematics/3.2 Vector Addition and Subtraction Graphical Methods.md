## Learning Objectives
- Understand the rules of vector addition, subtraction, and multiplication by scalars.
- Apply graphical methods of vector addition and subtraction to determine the displacement of moving objects.

## Notes
- In 2D, the direction of vectors can be represented by an angle.

- To subtract a vector, you add its negative. $A - B = A + (-B)$
- When a vector is multiplied by a scalar:
  - The magnitude of the vector becomes the absolute value of both magnitudes multiplied
  - If the scalar is positive, the vector's direction does not change
  - If the scalar is negative, the vector's direction is flipped

## Head-to-Tail Method for Adding Vectors
- Draw the first vector on a graph
- Place the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector
- Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.
  - This is the resultant, or the sum, of the vectors.
