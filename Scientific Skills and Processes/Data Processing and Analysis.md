## Getting Standard Deviation
Example Data Set:
| Trial #  | Time (seconds) |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1  | 0.23 |
| 2 | 0.35 |
| 3 | 0.27 |
| 4 | 0.39 |

### Step 1: Take the average of the measurements. 

$\frac{0.23+0.35+0.27+0.39}{4}=0.31$

### Step 2: Find variation by subtracting the average from each trial.

0.23 - 0.31 = -0.08 \
0.35 - 0.31 = 0.04 \
0.27 - 0.31 = -0.04 \
0.39 - 0.31 = 0.08

### Step 3. Square each result

-0.08^2 = 0.0064
0.04^2 = 0.0016 \
-0.04^2 = 0.0016 \
0.08^2 = 0.0064

### Step 4. Find the average to determine variance.

$\frac{0.0064+0.0016+0.0016+0.0064}{4}=0.004$

### Step 5. Find the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance

$\sqrt{0.004}=0.063$

For our table, our result is the average (0.31 sec) plus or minus the standard deviation (0.063 sec)

## Types of Graphs
* Bar Graph - Used when the independent variable is categoric or ordered
* Scatterplot - Points plotted in a graph
* Line Graph - Used when the indpendent variable is continuous, a scatterplot with an approximate line
* Pie Chart - Displays categoric data

## Other Notes
* Don't remove outliers for unique and individual data sets.
  * Should remove outliers: Same person does the same thing fives times
  * Should not remove outliers: Five different salts are used to melt ice
