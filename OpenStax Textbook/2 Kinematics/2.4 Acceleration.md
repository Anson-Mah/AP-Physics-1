## Learning Objectives
* Define average acceleration.
* Calculate acceleration given initial time, initial velocity, final time, and final velocity.

## Acceleration
* Greater acceleration means a greater change in velocity
* Average Acceleration - The rate at which velocity changes. Calculated by change in velocity dividied by elapsed time.
* Acceleration is a vector
* The direction of acceleration is not always in the direction of motion
  * If they are the same, then the object will speed up
  * If they differ, then the object will slow down

## SI Unit for Acceleration
* $m/s^2$, meters per second squared
* Tell us how many meters per second the velocity changes every second

## Graphical Representation of Acceleration

* Graph A
  * It is increasing, so its velocity is positive
  * As time increases, the derivative's slope becomes steeper.. This marks a positive acceleration.
  * Graph A is accelerating towards the right.
* Graph B
  * It is increasing, so its velocity is positive
  * As time increases, the derivative decreases. This marks a negative acceleration.
  * Graph B is decelerating, but heading towards the right
* Graph C
  * It is decreasing, so its velocity is negative
  * As time increases, the derivative's slope becomes steeper. This marks a positive acceleration.
  * Graph C is accelerating towards the left.
