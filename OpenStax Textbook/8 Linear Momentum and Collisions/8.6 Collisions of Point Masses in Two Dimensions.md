## 2D Collisions
Like 2D Kinematics and Dynamics, 2D Collisions can be broken up into the components of a convenient coordinate system.

## Equations
Equations for where mass 2 is initially at rest and it conserves momentum along the inital direction of mass 1

x-direction:

$m_1v_1 = m_1v'_1\cos\theta_1 + m_2v'_2\cos\theta_2$

y-direction:

$m_1v'_{1y}+m_2v'_{2y} = 0$


Equation for the internal kinetic energy before and after the collision of two objects with equal mass

$\frac{1}{2}mv^2_1 = \frac{1}{2}mv'^2_1 + \frac{1}{2}mv'^2_2 + mv'_1v'_2\cos(\theta_1-\theta_2)$
