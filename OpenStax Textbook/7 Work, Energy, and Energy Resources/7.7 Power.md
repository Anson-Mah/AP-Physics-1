## Power
Power: The rate at which work is done.

$P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$

SI Unit for Power: Watt (W)

1 Watt equals 1 Joule per Second (1 W = 1 J/s)

## Energy Consumption
In the modern world, we have to pay for energy. The higher the power consumption rate and the longer the appliance is used, the greater the cost of that appliance.

E = Energy supplied by the company

P = W/t = E/t

E = Pt

### Example Problem
What is the cost of running a 0.200 kilowatt computer 6.00 hours per day for 30.0 days if the cost of electricity is $0.120 per kilowatt-hour?

t = (6.00 hours/day) * (30.0 days) = 180. hours
P = 0.200 kilowatts

E = Pt = (180.)(0.200) = 36.0 kilowatt-hours

cost = (36.0 kilowatt-hours)($0.120) = **$4.32 per month**
