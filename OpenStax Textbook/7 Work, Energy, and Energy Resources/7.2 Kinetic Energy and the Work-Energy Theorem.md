## Notes
Work done on an object transfers energy to the object.

## Net Work
Net Work: Work done by the net force acting on an object

Net Work: The sum of work on an object

$W_{net} = F_{net}d\cos\theta$

Total Work Done = "Total Area Under the Curve"

## Work-Energy Theorem
The net work on a system equals the change in the quantity $\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$.

$W_{net} = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$

## Kinetic Energy
Translational Kinetic Energy (TKE) = $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.

Translational Kinetic Energy is the energy associated with translational motion. 

Kinetic energy is a form of energy associated with the motion of a particle, single body, or system of objects moving together.

Kinetic Energy is proportional to speed squared.
