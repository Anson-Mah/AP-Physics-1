## Definitions
* Kinematics - The study of motion without considering its cause
* Position - Where something is at a particular time
* Displacement - A change in position
* Distance - The magnitude of displacement between two positions
* Distance Travelled - The total length of the path across two positions
* Vector - A quantity with both magnitude and direction (ex. Displacement, Velocity)
* Scalar - A quantity with magnitude, but no direction. (ex. Temperature, Calories)
* Elapsed Time - Tells us how much time has passed
* Average Velocity - Displacement divided by Elapsed Time
* Average Speed - Distance Travelled divided by Elapsed Time

## Displacement vs Distance
* Displacement has a scale and direction, while distance only has a scale.

## Velocity
* Large displacement in a small timeframe equals a large velocuty
* Velocity has units of distance divided by time (ex. miles per hour)
* Velocity is a vector, having both magnitude and direction

## Speed
* Speed is a scalar, it has no direction
* Speed is the magnitude of velocity

## Average Speed vs. Average Velocity

## Acceleration
* Greater acceleration means a greater change in velocity
* Average Acceleration - The rate at which velocity changes. Calculated by change in velocity dividied by elapsed time.
* Acceleration is a vector
* The direction of acceleration is not always in the direction of motion
  * If they are the same, then the object will speed up
  * If they differ, then the object will slow down

## SI Unit for Acceleration
* $m/s^2$, meters per second squared
* Tell us how many meters per second the velocity changes every second

## Graphical Representation of Acceleration
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4a2561b-9007-4eb5-82f6-f6e372d06162)
* Graph A
  * It is increasing, so its velocity is positive
  * As time increases, the derivative's slope becomes steeper.. This marks a positive acceleration.
  * Graph A is accelerating towards the right.
* Graph B
  * It is increasing, so its velocity is positive
  * As time increases, the derivative decreases. This marks a negative acceleration.
  * Graph B is decelerating, but heading towards the right
* Graph C
  * It is decreasing, so its velocity is negative
  * As time increases, the derivative's slope becomes steeper. This marks a positive acceleration.
  * Graph C is accelerating towards the left.

## Kinematics Formulas
1. $x_f = x_0 + \bar v t$
2. $v_f = v_0 + at$
3. $x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
4. $v_f^2 = v^2_0 - 2a(x - x_0)$
