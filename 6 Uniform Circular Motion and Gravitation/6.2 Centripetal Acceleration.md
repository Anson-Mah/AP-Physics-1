## Learning Objectives
- Establish the expression for centripetal acceleration.
- Explain the centrifuge.

## Notes
- In uniform circular motion, the direction of the velocity changes constantly
  - This means there is always acceleration, even if the velocity's magnitude is constant
  - This type of accelration is "centripetal acceleration (a<sub>c</sub>)"
  - $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$ [Proof](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-ap-courses-2e/pages/6-2-centripetal-acceleration)

## Centrifuge
- Centrifuge: A rotating device that separates stuff based off on density
- Uses centrifugal force
- High centripetal acceleration leads to faster separation
