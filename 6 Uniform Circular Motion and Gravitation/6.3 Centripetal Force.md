## Centripetal Force
Definition: Any net force causing uniform circular motion

The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature
  - This is the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration.

Large centripetal force means a smaller radius. 

## Centripetal Force Equations
$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$

$F_c = m a_c = m \frac{v^2}{r} = m r \omega^2$

## Coefficient of Friction Example
A car is navigating a 500 m radius curve at 25.0 m/s.

Static friction between the tires and the road keep the car from slipping. Find the minimum static coefficient of friction between the tires and the road. 

First we will draw a Free Body Diagram.

Then we will do the following stuff:

## Banked Curves
Banked Curve: A curve that is not flat.

The slope of the banked curve helps you travel the curve faster. A greater angle helps you can travel the curve even faster.

## Ideal Banking
Ideally Banked Curve: The angle is such that you can travel the curve at a certain speed without the aid of friction.

In Ideal Banking, Net External Force = Horizontal Centriptal Force (Assuming no friction)
