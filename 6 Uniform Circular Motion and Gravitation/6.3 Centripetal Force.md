## Learning Objectives
- Calculate coefficient of friction on a car tire.
- Calculate ideal speed and angle of a car on a turn.

## Notes
- Centripetal Force: Any net force causing uniform circular motion
- The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature
  - This is the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration.
- Large centripetal force means a smaller radius. (See Flat Curve Equation #2)

## Banked Curves
- Banked Curve: A curve that is not flat.
- The slope of the banked curve helps you travel the curve faster. Greater angle means you can travel the curve faster.

## Ideal Banking
- Ideally Banked Curve: The angle is such that you can travel the curve at a certain speed without friction.
- Net External Force = Horizontal Centriptal Force (Assuming no friction)

## Flat Curve Equations
$F_c = m a_c = m \frac{v^2}{r} = m r \omega^2$

$r = \frac{m v^2}{F_c}$

## Banked Curve Equations
$N \cos\theta = mg$

$mg \tan\theta = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

$\tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$
