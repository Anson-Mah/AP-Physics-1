## Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation
Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force along a line joining them.

The magnitude of the force on each object is the same, consistent with Newton’s third law.

The two objects are Newton's Third Law pairs

### Equation

$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$

F = Gravitational Force

G = 6.674 x 10<sup>-11</sup>

m = Mass of objects

r = Distance between the two object's centers of mass

## Big G
$G = 6.674 * 10^{-11}$ Newtons times meters squared per kilogram squared

Big G is the same value everywhere in the universe


## Acceleration Due to Gravity

$g = G \frac{m}{r^2}$

g = Acceleration Due to Gravity

G = 6.674 x 10<sup>-11</sup>

m = Mass of the object

r = Distance to the center of the object
