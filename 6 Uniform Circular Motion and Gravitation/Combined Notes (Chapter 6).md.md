## Rotation Angle
- r = radius
- θ = angle
- s = arc length
- $\Delta \theta = \frac{s}{r}$
- $s = r \Delta \theta$

## Angular Velocity
- ω = angular velocity, the rate of change of an angle
- $\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$
- Units: Radians per Second (rad/s)

- v = Linear Velocity
- $v = \frac{s}{\Delta t}$
- $v = r \omega$
  - $v = \frac{s}{\Delta t} = \frac{r \Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = r \omega$

## Centripedal Acceleration
- In uniform circular motion, the direction of the velocity changes constantly
  - This means there is always acceleration, even if the velocity's magnitude is constant
  - This type of accelration is "centripetal acceleration (a<sub>c</sub>)"
  - $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} = r \omega^2$ [Proof](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-ap-courses-2e/pages/6-2-centripetal-acceleration)

## Centrifuge
- Centrifuge: A rotating device that separates stuff based off on density
- Uses centrifugal force
- High centripetal acceleration leads to faster separation

## Centripetal Force
- Centripetal Force: Any net force causing uniform circular motion
- The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature
  - This is the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration.
- Large centripetal force means a smaller radius. (See Flat Curve Equation #2)

## Banked Curves
- Banked Curve: A curve that is not flat.
- The slope of the banked curve helps you travel the curve faster. Greater angle means you can travel the curve faster.

## Ideal Banking
- Ideally Banked Curve: The angle is such that you can travel the curve at a certain speed without friction.
- Net External Force = Horizontal Centriptal Force (Assuming no friction)

## Flat Curve Equations
$F_c = m a_c = m \frac{v^2}{r} = m r \omega^2$

$r = \frac{m v^2}{F_c}$

## Banked Curve Equations
$N \cos\theta = mg$

$mg \tan\theta = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

$\tan\theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$

## Big G
$G = 6.674 * 10^{-11}$ Newtons times meters squared per kilogram squared

Big G is the same value everywhere in the universe

$g = G \frac{m}{r^2}$
