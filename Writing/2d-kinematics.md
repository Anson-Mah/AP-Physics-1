# Part A
We are asked to calculate how far away from the table that the ball on the right will land.

Based on the information given, we can assume the following variables in the horizontal direction:
- Initial Velocity (v<sub>0</sub>) = v (Given)
- Initial Position (x<sub>0</sub>) = 0 (The ball leaves the table)
- Acceleration (a) = 0 (In horizontal motion, velocity is constant)

Based on the information given, we can assume the following variables in the vertical direction:
- Initial Position (x<sub>0</sub>) = h (Given)
- Acceleration (a) = -9/8 m/s<sup>2</sup> (Given)
- Final Position (x<sub>f</sub>) = 0 (The ball lands)
- Initial Velocity (v<sub>0</sub>) = 0 (The ball is dropped)

In order to complete the task of Part A, I will first need to calculate the time it takes for the ball to land. I will be working in the verical axis and use the Kinematics Equations to do this. 

We can use the kinematics equation $x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$ to solve for t.

$x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$

$0 = h + (0)t + \frac{1}{2} (-9.8) t^2$

$0 = h + 0 + -4.9 t^2$

$0 = h + -4.9 t^2$

$-h = -4.9 t^2$

$\frac{-h}{-4.9} = t^2$

$\frac{h}{4.9} = t^2$

$\plusmn\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}} = t$

Since time cannot be negative, $t$ has to be positive.

$t = \sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$

Now that we have the time it takes for the ball to land, we can shift our focus onto the horizontal axis. We can simply just multiply the given velocity by $t$ to find out the distance the ball has travelled.

In other words, we can use the equation $x_f = x_0 + vt$.

$x_f = x_0 + vt$

$x_f = 0 + v\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$

$x_f = v\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$

Therefore, given horizontal velocity (v) and the ball's initial height above the floor (h), we can conclude that the ball on the right will have travelled a distance of $v\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$ meters away from the table when it has landed.

# Part B
For Part B, we are asked to draw a vertical velocity vs time graph for the left and right balls, then comapre and contrast the graphs.

Here is a graph for the left ball's vertical velocity.


Here is a graph for the right ball's vertical velocity.

These two graphs are the exact same. This is because horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Since both balls are in free fall, that means they both have an acceleration of -9.8 meters per second per second. This means that for both balls, the velocity increases by -9.8 meters per second every second.

In terms of vertical velocity, there are no differences between the left and right balls.

# Part C
A question is asked. Will both balls hit the ground at the same time? If not, then which ball will hit the ground first?

**Both balls will hit the ground at the same time.** Reiterating my point from Part B, horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Since both balls are in free fall and have both started from the same vertical position, they will both land at the same time.

# Part D
For Part D, we are assigned a concrete measurement (5 meters) for our variable h. We are asked to calculate the amount of time it will take for the balls to strike the ground.

From Part A, we have calculated that the time it takes for the balls to land is equal to $\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$. Plugging in 5 for h, we get the following:

$t = \sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$

$t = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4.9}}$

Compute.

$t \approx 1.01015$

Round to correct sig-figs.

$t = 1$

It takes **one second** for the ball to strike the ground.

# Part E
For Part E, we are assigned two numerical value. For horizontal velocity (v) for the ball on the right, we have 12 meters per second. For initial distance between the two balls (d), we have 8 meters.

We are asked to find the final horizontal distance between the two balls based on where each ball strikes the ground.

In Part A, I set the inital horiontal position for the ball on the right to be 0. I will do the same for Part E. 

Therefore, our initial position for the left ball is -8 meters. Since horizontal position does not change for the left ball, its final position will too, be -8 meters.

Shifting our focus onto the ball on the right, we concluded from Part A that the ball will have travelled a distance of $v\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$ meters away from the table when it has landed. 

From Part D, we have found $\sqrt{\frac{h}{4.9}}$ to be 1. Therefore, our distance is $1v$, which is just $v$.

Since we are given that $v = 12$, our ball on the right has travelled a distance of 12 meters.

Now we know that the left ball is at a position of -8 meters and and right ball is a position of +12 meters.

The distance between -8 and 12 is 20. (12-(-8)=20)

Therefore, the balls are **20 meters** apart from each other when they have landed.
