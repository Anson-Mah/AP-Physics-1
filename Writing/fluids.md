Based on the data of the rectangular prisms above, another characteristic of each object we can calculate is volume. The volume of a rectangular prism is the product of its height, length, and width. 

We can calculate the volume of each object, then add it as a new column in our data table.

# Part B
The aluminium cube is the most likely candidate to not float in the water because it has the heaviest density. 

# Part C
**INSERT FBDF**

$\Sigma F = ma$

$\Sigma F$ comprises of two forces. The Buoyant Force ($F_B$), which points upward, and the Force of Gravity ($F_g$), which points downward. 

$F_B - F_g = ma$

The object is floating, so it is not rising and it is not sinking. In order for this to be true, the Buoyant Force and the Force of Gravity must cancel each other out. Therefore, the acceleration is 0 because the object is not biased to accelerate in either direction.

$F_B - F_g = m(0)$ 

$F_B - F_g = 0$ 

$F_B = F_g$ 

# Part D

For the experiment, we will need:

- Water, and a container for that water
- The objects
- A ruler 
- A scale

Take any one object.

First,  measure the volumes of that objects with the ruler. All of the objects we have are rectangular prisms, so no matter what, all we need to do is measure the object's length, width, and height and multiply those three values to get our volumes. Let's call the volume we measured in this step $v_o$.

Second, we measure the mass of the oject with the scale. Let's call the mass of the object $m$.

Now, we will place the object in the water.

If the object floats, measure the volume of the object above the water. We can use a similar process that we used in the first step of our experiment. Use the ruler to measure the length, width, and height of the object above the water. Let's call the volume we measured in this step $v_a$.

Now, take that volume that we just measured and subtract it from our original volume that we measured before placing the object in water ($v_o - v_a$). The result is the volume of water we displaced by placing the object in the water. Let's call the volume we measured in this step $v_d$.

If the object sinks, we don't need to do anything. The volume of water that we displaced by placing the object in the water is the same as the volume of the object we placed in the water ($v_d = v_o$). This is because if the object sinks, then it is fully submerged in the water. 

To calculate the density of the water, we will take the mass of the object we used, and divide it by the volume of water displaced by the object ($\frac{m}{v_d}$). 

We will then repeat this process for all of the objects.

# Part E
Multiple objects should be used for the experiment to ensure consistent results. 

# Part F
If object floats, $\rho_w = \frac{m_o}{lwy}$.

If object sinks, $\rho_w = \frac{m_o}{lwh}$.
