# Part A
We are asked to find the initial gravitational potential energy of the box.

Initial gravitational potential energy is equal to $mgh$

$h$ is change in height, which in this case would be the vertical component of $d$ because the box is distance $d$ from the bottom of the ramp. 

Therefore, $h = \sin d$

The initial gravitational potential energy is equal to $mg\sin d$

# Part B
We are asked to find the velocity of the box when it reaches the ground.

We first need to find at what time the box reaches the ground.

We can use the kinematics equation $x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2$. 

We'll take variables relating to the vertical motion of the box because acceleration is equal to g.

x<sub>f</sub> = 0 (Box reaches bottom of the ramp)

x<sub>0</sub> = $\sin d$ (Vertical distance from bottom of the ramp)

v<sub>0</sub> = 0 (Box starts at rest)

a = g

Now we plug in and solve for t.

$x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2$

$0 = \sin d + 0 t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

$0 = \sin d + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

$-\sin d = \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

$-2\sin d = gt^2$

$\frac{-2\sin d}{g} = t^2$

$t = \sqrt{\frac{-2\sin d}{g}}$

Now we can use the kinematics equation $v_f = v_0 + at$ to find final velocity

$v_f = v_0 + at$

$v_f = 0 + g\sqrt{\frac{-2\sin d}{g}}$

$v_f = g\sqrt{\frac{-2\sin d}{g}}$

# Part D
When the box is at the top of its ramp, its mechanical energy comprises of gravitational potential energy.

As established from Part A, that energy is equal to $mg\sin d$.

As the box slides down the ramp, its gravitational potential energy gets converted into kinetic energy.

When the box compressed the spring, that kinetic energy gets converted into the potential energy of the spring.

We know that the Potential Energy of a spring is $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$.

Since mechanical energy is conserved, we can conclude that the box's initial gravitational potential energy is equal to the potential energy of the spring.

$mg\sin d = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

The total amount that the spring will be compressed is the spring's displacement, $x$. Therefore, we will solve for $x$. 

$mg\sin d = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

$2mg\sin d = kx^2$

$\frac{2mg\sin d}{k} = x^2$

$\sqrt{\frac{2mg\sin d}{k}} = x$


With a spring constant, k, the compression of the spring is equal to $\sqrt{\frac{2mg\sin d}{k}}$.

# Part E
The box will end up at a same height as before. This is because all mechanical energy is conserved due to the lack of forces such as friction. There are no forces that would make the box lose or gain energy, so the box would simply return to its initial height.
