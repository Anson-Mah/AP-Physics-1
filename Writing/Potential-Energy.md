# Part A
We are asked to find the initial gravitational potential energy of the box.

Initial gravitational potential energy is equal to $mgh$

$h$ is change in height, which in this case would be the vertical component of $d$ because the box is distance $d$ from the bottom of the ramp. 

Therefore, $h = \sin d$

The initial gravitational potential energy is equal to $mg\sin d$

# Part B
We are asked to find the velocity of the box when it reaches the ground.

We first need to find at what time the box reaches the ground.

We can use the kinematics equation $x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2$. 

We'll take variables relating to the vertical motion of the box because acceleration is equal to g.

x<sub>f</sub> = 0 (Box reaches bottom of the ramp)

x<sub>0</sub> = $\sin d$ (Vertical distance from bottom of the ramp)

v<sub>0</sub> = 0 (Box starts at rest)

a = g

Now we plug in and solve for t.

$x_f = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} at^2$

$0 = \sin d + 0 t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

$0 = \sin d + \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

$-\sin d = \frac{1}{2} gt^2$

$-2\sin d = gt^2$

$\frac{-2\sin d}{g} = t^2$

$t = \sqrt{\frac{-2\sin d}{g}}$

Now we can use the kinematics equation $v_f = v_0 + at$ to find final velocity

$v_f = v_0 + at$

$v_f = 0 + g\sqrt{\frac{-2\sin d}{g}}$

$v_f = g\sqrt{\frac{-2\sin d}{g}}$

# Part C
**EBAR**

# Part D
We know that the Potential Energy of a spring is $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$. We will just solve for x.

$PE_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

$2PE_s = kx^2$

$\frac{2PE_s}{k} = x^2$

$x = \frac{2PE_s}{k}$

Will a spring constant, k, the compression of the spring is equal to $\frac{2PE_s}{k}$.

# Part E
The box will end up at a lower height than before. This is because even though all energy is conserved, some "useful energy" was lost from the collision, meaning that the box will not be able to reach the height it initially had.
