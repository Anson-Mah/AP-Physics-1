## Work Done Against Gravity
Work done against gravity (ex. lifting an object) is defined as gravitational potential energy ($PE_g$). This energy is associated with the state of separation between two objects that attract each other by gravitational force.

The change in gravitational potential energy ($\Delta PE_g$) equals mass (m) times g times the increase in height (h).


## Kinetic Energy
As an object descends without friction, its gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy corresponding to increasing speed.

Kinetic Energy equals the negative of Gravitational Potential Energy
