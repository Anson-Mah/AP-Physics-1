## Work

Definition: Work is energy transferred to an object via the application of force on it through a displacement.

$W = Fd \cos\theta$

F = Force

d = Displacement

θ = Angle between the Force vector and the Displacement vector

## Units for Work

Work is expressed in force times distance. 

The SI unit for Work is the Joule (J). 

1 Joule (J) = 1 Newton-Meter (N*m)

## Example Problem

Imagine a person pushing a lawn mower. If the person exerts a constant force of 75.0 Newtons at an angle 35.0° below the horizontal and pushes the mower 25.0 meters on level ground, how much work is done on the lawn mower?

F = 75.0 N

d = 25.0 m

θ = 35.0°

$W = Fd \cos\theta$

$W = (75.0)(25.0)(\cos(35.0°))$

W = 1540 J
