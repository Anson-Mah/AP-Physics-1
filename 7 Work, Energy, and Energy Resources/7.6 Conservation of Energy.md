## Law of Conservation of Energy
Law of Conservation of Energy: Total energy is constant in any process. It may change in form or be transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same.

$FE_0 + PE_0 + W_{nc} + OE_0 = KE_f + PE_f + OE_f$

At this point, any energy other than Kinetic (KE) or Potential (PE) are considered "Other Energy" (OE).

## Efficiency
Even though energy is conserved in an energy conversion process, the output of useful energy (work) will be less than the energy input.

The efficiency (Eff) of an energy conversion process is defined as useful energy (work output) divided by total energy input.
