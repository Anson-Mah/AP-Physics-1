## Notes
Conservative Force: A force where work depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion, not on the path taken.

Potential Energy can be defined for any conservative force. 

## Potential Energy of a Spring
The Potential Energy of a Spring ($PE_s$) equals $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where k is the spring force constant and x is the spring's displacement.

$PE_s = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

## Mechanical Energy
Mechanical Energy for a conservative force is Potential Energy plus Kinetic Energy.

$ME = KE + PE$

For any process that only involves conservative forces, its Mechcanical Energy is constant. This is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle.
