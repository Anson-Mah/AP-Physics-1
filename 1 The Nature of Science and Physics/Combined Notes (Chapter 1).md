## Definitions
* Model - A representation of something that is difficult or impossible to display directly
* Theory - Supported by scientific evidence, an explanation for natural phenomena. Also verified multiple times by peer review.
* Law - The use of concise language to describe a natural phenomena.
* Classical Physics - Physics as developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 1800s.
* Modern Physics - Comes after Classical Physics. Characterized by Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.
* Relativity - A field of physics, used for objects travelling grater than 1% the speed of light, or for objects experiencing a strong gravitational field
* Quantum Mechanics - A field of physics, studies objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope
* Relativistic Quantum Mechanics - Combines both Relativity and Quantum Mechanics
* Fundamental Units - Units that can only be expressed relative to the procedure used to measure them. These units are Length, Mass, Time, and Electric Charge.
* Derived Unit - Units that can be expressed as a combination of fundamental units

## Law & Theory: Similarities and Differences
* Laws can be explained concicsely, while theories cannot.
* Theories are much more complex and dynamic compared to laws.
* A law describes a single thing, but a theory explains an entire group of related phenomena.
  
## SI Units
* Length: Meter (m)
* Mass: Kilogram (kg)
* Time: Second (s)
* Electric Charge: Coulomb (c)
