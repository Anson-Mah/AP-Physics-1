## Learning Objectives
* Explain the relationships between average velocity, average speed, displacement, and time.
* Calculate velocity and speed given initial position, initial time, final position, and final time.

## Definitions
* Elapsed Time - Tells us how much time has passed
* Average Velocity - Displacement divided by Elapsed Time
* Average Speed - Distance Travelled divided by Elapsed Time

## Velocity
* Large displacement in a small timeframe equals a large velocuty
* Velocity has units of distance divided by time (ex. miles per hour)
* Velocity is a vector, having both magnitude and direction

## Speed
* Speed is a scalar, it has no direction
* Speed is the magnitude of velocity

## Average Speed vs. Average Velocity
