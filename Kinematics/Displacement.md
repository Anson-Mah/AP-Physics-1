## Learning Objectives
* Define position, displacement, distance, and distance travelled in a particular frame of reference.
* Explain the relationship between position and displacement
* Distinguish between displacement and distance traveled.
* Calculate displacement and distance given initial position, final position, and the path between the two.

## Definitions
* Kinematics - The study of motion without considering its cause
* Position - Where something is at a particular time
* Displacement - A change in position
* Distance - The magnitude of displacement between two positions
* Distance Travelled - The total length of the path across two positions

## Other Notes
* Displacement has a scale and direction, while distance only has a scale.
