## The Second Condition for Equilibrium
The net external torque on the system must be zero. ($\tau_{net} = 0$)

## Torque
Torque: A measure of how effective a force is in changing angular velocity. How effectively a force can change or accelerate a rotation. 

$\tau = rF\sin\theta$

$\tau$ (Lowercase tau) = Torque

r = Distance from pivot point to where the force is applied

F = Magnitude of the force causing the torque

Î¸ = Angle between the direction of F and the direction of r

Torque is a vector.

The SI unit for torque is the Newton-Meter (N * m).

Despite Newton-Meters being the same as the Joule, Torque is measured in Newton-Meters in order to differentiate torque from work and energy.

Torque in rotational motion is like force in linear motion.

## Perpendicular Lever Arm

$r_{\perp}$ is the symbol for the perpendicular lever arm.

$r_{\perp} = r\sin\theta$

$\tau = r_{\perp}F$
