# Part B
We want to know the maximum velocity of the block and where it occurs.

We will first see *where* the maximum velocity of the block occurs, then use that fact to dertmine *what* the maximum velocity of the block is.

Let's take our graph from Part A. 

**INSERT SINEAT**

This graph shows us five oscillations of the spring-block system. All five oscillations of the system are the exact same because there is no friction or damping.

Since all five oscillations of the system are the exact same, let's just focus on one oscillation.

**INSERT SINEONE**

We know that the slope of a Position-Time graph is Velocity. We also know that a steeper slope represents a greater slope. In the case of a Position-Time graph, a greater slope would mean a greater Velocity.

So to find the place where the block has the greatest velocity, we simply need to find the place with the steepest slope.

What happens in one oscillation? The spring starts at Position -A at the start of the cycle. Halfway through the cycle, the spring ends up a Position A. Then at the end of the cycle, the spring ends up back a Position -A.

Position A and Position -A are what we call "extrema". The limit. The block does not go further than Position A in the positive direction, but also does not go further than Position -A in the negative direction. 

Notice the slope of the positions at these extrema. They are a straight line, and therefore have a slope of zero. This is because they are the extrema. Before reaching either extrema, the magnitude of the position of the block is less than that extrema. After passing either extrema, the magnitude of the position of the block is also less than that extrema. 

**INSERT SINESLOPEZERO**

Let's focus on one-half of an oscillation.

**INSERT SINESLOPEZEROPINK**

On the edges of the half-oscillation are the extrema, Position -A and Position A. We already know that the slopes of these points are zero. 

But what are the slopes of the points in between the extrema?

Let's take a look.

**INSERT SINESLOPEZEROPINKBLUELINES**

The blue lines represent the slope of the graph at that position. Notice that the closer the points are to the extrema, the smaller the slopes get. Notice that the further away the points are to the extrema, the steeper the slope gets.

With this observation, we can conclude that the point that is farthest from either extrema has to be te point of maximum velocity. 

So, what is that point?

That point would be the middle of this half-oscillation.

**INSERT SINESLOPEZEROPINKBLUELINESYELLOWPOINT**

At this center point, the slope of the graph is the greatest and steepest.

Before the center point, the slope is smaller than the center point because any point between Position -A and the center point is closer to Position -A compared to the center point.

After the center point, the slope is also smaller than the center point because any point between Position A and the center point is closer to Position A compared to the center point.

The position of this point of maximum velocity is zero. Therefore, the maximum velocity occurs where the position of the block would be zero. That position is the equilibrium position, the position in between Position -A and Position A.

To find the actual value of the maximum velocity, we have a convenient formula given to us on Chapter 16.3 in the textbook.

$v_{max} = X\sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$, where $X$ is the amplitude, or maximum displacement, of the block.

In our case, the amplitude is A. The maximum displacement of the block is A or -A, but amplitude is a scalar so we must take the positive value. 

The maximum velocity of the block, therefore, is equal to $A\sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$.

### Quick Summary of Part B

The maximum velocity of the block is equal to $A\sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$. 

The maximum velocity of the block occurs at Position 0.

# Part C
$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$

$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{M}{k}}$

$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{M}{k}}}$

$\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{M}{k}}}$

$\omega = \frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{\frac{M}{k}}}$

$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M/K}}$

$\omega = \sqrt{1 \div \frac{M}{k}}$

$\omega = \sqrt{1 * \frac{k}{M}}$

$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$

# Part D
Yes, our answer from Part B agrees with the formula $v = Aω$.

The answer we got in Part B is $v_{max} = A\sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$.

In the formula $v = Aω$, the velocity is explicitly stated to be the maximum velocity, so $v = v_{max}$.

We know from Part C that $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$.

Using substitution, we can conclude that answer from Part B and the formula $v = Aω$ are the same.

# Part E

If amplitude was increased, the period of oscillation would remain the same. This is because amplitude has no effect on the period of oscillation.

If amplitude was increased, then the maximum velocity of the block would increase. This is because $v_{max} = A\sqrt{\frac{k}{M}}$, so if $A$ was increased, $v_{max}$ would also need to increase in order for the equation to remain true,
