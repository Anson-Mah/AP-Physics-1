# Part B	
We are asked to find Tension (T).

Let's draw a free-body diagram, but this time we split the weight force into its components.

Tension is on the parallel axis, meaning that we only need to focus on parallel forces.

The box is not moving, meaning that all the parallel forces cancel out.

On the left of the box are the forces of tension (T) and friction (f). To the right of the box is the parallel weight (w<sub>II</sub>).

These forces cancel out, meaning that $T + f = w_\parallel$

Rearranging to isolate Tension, we have $T = w_\parallel - f$

Therefore, the tension in the rope is equal to the parallel weight of the box minus the force of friction.

# Part C
We now have a scenario where the rope is cut and the incline is frictionless. 

We are asked to find the  acceleration of the block down the incline.

Since the rope is cut, there is no more tension. This means that $T = 0$.

Since the incline is frictionless, that means $f = 0$.

Now, the only force parallel to the incline is the parallel component of weight (w<sub>II</sub>).

Therefore, **the acceleration of the box is equal to the parallel component of weight (w<sub>II</sub>)**.

We can define this variable in terms of other variables.

Remember that we have the box's mass (M) and the angle of the incline ($\theta$).

We know that $w = Mg$ and also that $w_\parallel = w\sin(\theta)$

Therefore, $w_\parallel = Mg\sin(\theta)$

Therefore, the acceleration of the box is also equal to the mass of the box times the force of gravity times the sine of the incline angle.

# Part D
**REPLACE WPAR**

# Part E
Part C identifies a value for acceleration, the parallel component of the object's weight. Part D graphs the velocity as a non-horizontal straight line.

Yes, both answers agree with each other. 

Both answers show us a constant acceleration, which is why the two answers agree with each other.

# Part F
**REPLACE WPARMFRIC**

# Part G
One similarity between the slopes of the two graphs is that they both remain the same throughout the entire graph.

Another similarity between the slopes of the two graphs is that they are both positive slopes.

A difference between the slopes of the two graphs is that Graph D's slope will be steeper than Graph F's slope at any time other than 0. This is because the acceleration for Graph D is higher than Graph F because Part D assumes a frictionless incline while Part F accounts for friction. Notice that the y-axis values for Graph D are $w_\parallel$, while the y-axis values for Graph F are $w_\parallel - f$.
